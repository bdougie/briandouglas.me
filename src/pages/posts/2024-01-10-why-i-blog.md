I recently sat down with swyx to chat about his recent blog post about building digital communities. This is top of mind for folks, and I am confident anyone that works with or around developer tooling will find it pretty insightful.  

[Listen to that conversation on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/953959461) (expires in 6 days).

## My thoughts on DevRel

I have been seriously thinking about my role at GitHub for the past 6 months. I went from frequent travel to zero travel in 2020. My interest in online content creation also went from pretty infrequent to overwhelmingly consistent. 

My approach to shipping YouTube videos and regular blog posts has all been through the lens of scaling. I have successfully turned my Friday live streaming into a time to produce live podcasts, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Before 2020, I spent my nights and weekends crafting out creative content. Now I can incorporate it as a process of my day job. 

## What's next?
The need to get conference abstracts accepted is a distant thought. My focus is now on crafting conference talks as YouTube videos. I see guesting on live streams as the new conference in 2021. I see podcasts as the new hallway track and YouTube to engage new audiences in clever ways.  

Suppose you have a YouTube channel, podcasts, or live stream. I would love to join you in 2021 and connect with new audiences. If you also thoughts on this, consider joining the conversation on this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devrel/comments/m6tjb3/everything_i_thought_about_developers_relations/).

## YouTube
In this video, I react to @chrissean announcement about his new role. Spoiler: This is a 100% positive reaction because I enjoy hearing how developers make it to get their first, second, next job. I find it inspirational and helpful for folks coming up behind them. It is the reason why I share my story on this channel and why I wanted to share and celebrate a fellow Youtuber getting their latest job in DevRel.
