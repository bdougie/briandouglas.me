Astro is a modern static site builder that offers an exciting new approach to building websites. In this post, I'll share my experience with Astro and why I think it's a great choice for content-focused websites.

## Why Astro?

Astro stands out for several reasons:

1. **Zero JavaScript by default**: Astro automatically removes all JavaScript from your site, delivering only HTML and CSS.
2. **Component Islands**: Use your favorite UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) where needed.
3. **Great Developer Experience**: Familiar syntax and excellent tooling support.

## Code Example

Here's a simple Astro component:

```astro
---
// Your component script goes here
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
---

<div class="greeting">
  <h1>{greeting}</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
</div>

<style>
  .greeting {
    color: navy;
    padding: 1rem;
  }
</style>
```

## Performance

Astro's approach to JavaScript is particularly interesting. By shipping zero JavaScript by default, your sites are:

- Faster to load
- More secure
- Better for SEO
- More accessible

## Conclusion

Astro represents a significant step forward in static site generation. Its focus on performance and developer experience makes it an excellent choice for modern web development.
